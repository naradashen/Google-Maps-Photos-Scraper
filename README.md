## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Dynamic Content & Error Handling

Google Maps is a highly dynamic platform that frequently updates its interface and underlying DOM structure. As a result, you might encounter occasional errors such as:

- **Element Not Found:** The photo gallery button or thumbnail container may have updated attributes.
- **Scrolling Issues:** Dynamic content loading can affect the scroll behavior of the thumbnail container.
- **Timeouts:** Elements may take longer to load during periods of high traffic or due to network conditions.

*This repository is provided as a starting point. Users are encouraged to modify and enhance the code according to their specific requirements and changes in the Google Maps interface.*
